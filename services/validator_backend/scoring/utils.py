The news of the suspected spy\u2019s arrest was first reported on Monday by Quotidien, a daily politics and culture show on the Monaco-based television channel TMC. The show cited \u201ca judicial source in Paris\u201d and said that France\u2019s domestic security and counterintelligence agency, the General Directorate for Internal Security (DGSI), was in charge of the espionage case.\n\nThe senior administrator has been identified as Benoit Quennedey, a civil servant who liaises between the French Senate and the Department of Architecture and Heritage, which operates under France\u2019s Ministry of Culture. Quennedey was reportedly detained on Sunday morning and his office in the French Senate was raided by DGSI officers on the same day. Quotidien said that he was arrested on suspicion of \u201ccollecting and delivering to a foreign power information likely to subvert core national interests\u201d. The report did not provide specific information about the type of information that Quennedey is believed to have passed to North Korea. It did state, however, that a counterintelligence investigation into his activities began in March of this year.\n\nQuennedey is believed to be the president of the Franco-Korean Friendship Association, the French branch of a Spanish-based organization that lobbies in favor of international support for North Korea. Korea Friendship Association branches exist in over 30 countries and are believed to be officially sanctioned by Pyongyang. They operate as something akin to the pre-World War II Comintern (Communist International), a Moscow-sanctioned international pressure group that advocated in favor of Soviet-style communism around the world. French media reported on Monday that Quennedey traveled extensively to the Korean Peninsula in the past decade and has written a French-language book on North Korea. News reports said that the French President Emmanuel Macron had been made aware of Quennedey\u2019s arrest. The senior civil servant faces up to 30 years in prison if found guilty of espionage.\n\n\u25ba Author: Joseph Fitsanakis | Date: 27 November 2018 | Permalink\n\n",
